# RKS-Project
The project has been made with the base of wireframe,workflow,UAT and requirement specifications.

But with some changes such as the assignment collection in the website will be in a form of link to google drive and not in a form of file being collected through the website.

The website still uses account for lecturer and student the same as the original wireframe, workflow and UAT.

Because the database of the account has not been connected in the website so that the register form for account has not been made

the lecturer's account username:lecturer password:lecturer

student username: admin password:uad

the screenshot of the website will be provided in the github also.

the link to wireframe,workflow,UAT and requirement specifications:
